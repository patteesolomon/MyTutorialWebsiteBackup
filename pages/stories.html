            I worked a lot with an engine called RPG Maker XP.
            <br>
            My time was spent on trying to code new things.
            <br>
            But I couldn't because it was really hard at first.
            <br>
            Nothing really got done until 
            <br>
            I learned about how a pipline
            worked.
            <br>
            After that all the pain and suffering I acrued from 
            <br>
            that self denial and imposter syndrome I learned how
            <br>
            to code in C#.
            <br>
            And from that moment forward I was even more skilled
            <br> 
            then ever.
            <br>
            And "Light of Enginuity" as one of my instructors called
            <br>
            it, was lit.
